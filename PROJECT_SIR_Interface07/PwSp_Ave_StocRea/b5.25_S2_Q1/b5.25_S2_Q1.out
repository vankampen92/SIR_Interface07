 MODEL COMMAND LINE RUNNING PARAMETERS:
 -Q 1  >> Seasonal Forcing Control:
      Q = 0 (Non-activation of an equivalent Transmission Rate)
      Q = 1 (Non Seasonal Forced dynamics with an equivalent Beta)

        S = 0 (No Seasonal Forcing)
        S = 1 (Sinusoidal Seasonal Forcing)
        S = 2 (beta = b_0 * (1 + b_1)^(Term))
        S = 3 (beta = b_0 * (1. + Term * b_1))
        where Term is +1 for school terms and -1 for holidays

  Direct Transmission Rates (Beta):
 -b 5.25 >> 	b=5.25
 -B[k]   >> Maximum and Minimum Transmission rates
       >> k = 0,1
       >> b_0 = 5.25 and b_1= 0.25
 -Y 365 >> Characteristic Period of the Seasonal Forcing
  External Transmission Rates (Immigration):
 -e 1e-05
