 MODEL COMMAND LINE RUNNING PARAMETERS:
 -Q 0  >> Seasonal Forcing Control:
      Q = 0 (Non-activation of an equivalent Transmission Rate)
      Q = 1 (Non Seasonal Forced dynamics with an equivalent Beta)
 -S 2  >> Seasonal Forcing Control:
        S = 0 (No Seasonal Forcing)
        S = 1 (Sinusoidal Seasonal Forcing)
        S = 2 (beta = b_0 * (1 + b_1)^(Term))
        S = 3 (beta = b_0 * (1. + Term * b_1))
        where Term is +1 for school terms and -1 for holidays
 -R 500 >> No REPLICAS or Stochastic Realizations
 -L 1000000 >> Simulation Length
 -F 2048 >> No. of Points entering Spectral Analysis
 Times defining the Staonary Regim:
 -t0 500.000000 >> Initial Time

 -I 138 >> Initial number of Infective Individuals
 -M 44970 >> Initial number of Immune Individuals
 -d 5.5e-05 >> Natural Mortality Rate
  Induced Mortality:

  Direct Transmission Rates (Beta):
 -b 0.4 >> 	b=0.4
 -B[k]   >> Maximum and Minimum Transmission rates
       >> k = 0,1

 -Y 365 >> Characteristic Period of the Seasonal Forcing
  External Transmission Rates (Immigration):
 -e 1e-05
