 MODEL COMMAND LINE RUNNING PARAMETERS:
 -Q 1  >> Seasonal Forcing Control:
      Q = 0 (Non-activation of an equivalent Transmission Rate)
      Q = 1 (Non Seasonal Forced dynamics with an equivalent Beta)
 -S 2  >> Seasonal Forcing Control:
        S = 0 (No Seasonal Forcing)
        S = 1 (Sinusoidal Seasonal Forcing)
        S = 2 (beta = b_0 * (1 + b_1)^(Term))
        S = 3 (beta = b_0 * (1. + Term * b_1))
        where Term is +1 for school terms and -1 for holidays
 -R 500 >> No REPLICAS or Stochastic Realizations
 -L 1000000 >> Simulation Length
 -F 2048 >> No. of Points entering Spectral Analysis

Between 500.000000 and 60000.000000 there are 2006 points: t[2006] = 59988.910156
Between 500.000000 and 60000.000000 there are only 2006 points!
Stochastic simulations should last longer, i.e, t_1 should be larger
