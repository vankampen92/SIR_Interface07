 MODEL RUNNING PARAMETERS:
 -D 0  >> Disarding time series where there is an extinction:
      D = 0 (Without discarding Extinctions)
      D = 1 (Discarding Extinctions)
 -Q 1  >> Seasonal Forcing Control:
      Q = 0 (Non-activation of an equivalent Transmission Rate)
      Q = 1 (Non Seasonal Forced dynamics with an equivalent Beta)
 -S 2  >> Seasonal Forcing Control:
        S = 0 (No Seasonal Forcing)
        S = 1 (Sinusoidal Seasonal Forcing)
        S = 2 (beta = b_0 * (1 + b_1)^(Term)
        S = 3 (beta = b_0 * (1. + Term * b_1)
        where Term is +1 for school terms and -1 for holidays

  Direct Transmission Rates (Beta):
 -b 1.5 >> 	b=1.5
 -B[k]   >> Maximum and Minimum Transmission rates
       >> k = 0,1
       >> b_0 = 1.5 and b_1= 0.25
 -mu 0 >> Loss of Immnunity Rate

  Non Seasonal Forcing with an equivalent effective Transmission Rate (Beta)
  Initial Seasonal Transmission Rate: Beta = 1.5 *(1. + 0.25)^(Term),
  being Term = -1.,1.
  Equivalent Constant Transmission Rate: Beta = 1.48813	b_1 = 0.
